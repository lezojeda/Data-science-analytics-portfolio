    - [Stomatal conductance of *Sorghum bicolor*](https://github.com/lezojeda/Data-science-analytics-portfolio/blob/master/Stomatal_conductance.pdf): An analysis of this species' stomatal conductance for my biology master degree's final thesis. The objective was to determine the effects of time, salt concentrations and genotype on the stomatal conductance, a measure of the rate of passage of carbon dioxide (CO2) entering, or water vapor exiting through the stomata of leaves (small pores on the its epidermis).
